  <title>Bridge Troll</title>
  <body>
    <p>As I neared the bridge, a troll lumbered from the bushes and stood in my path. Sweat glistened on his bulging gray muscles and stained his leather jerkin. The stench made my eyes water.</p>
    <p><q>10 gold,</q> he growled, weighing a nail-studded club in clawed hands.</p>
